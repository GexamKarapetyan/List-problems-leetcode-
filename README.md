1.Linked List Cycle
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

2.Insertion Sort List
Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.
The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:
Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
It repeats until no input elements remain.

3.Remove Linked List Elements
Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

4. Reverse Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list

5. Add Digits
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

6.Merge Two Sorted Lists
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

7.Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

8.Partition List
Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

9.Rotate List
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

10.Middle of the Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
